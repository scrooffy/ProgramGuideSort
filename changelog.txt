Created 3 february 2022 on PowerShell
    - added feature of deleting midnight shows

Update from 3 April 2022
    - rewritten in Python cuz I'm tired of this shi.. I mean PowerShell
    - reworked 'Delete midnight shows' module, now they got smarter and don't delete morning shows
    - added sorting channels by day
    - optimized program guide space by removal consecutive identical shows 
      and listing the times of the show in one line
    - few unimportant but nice little things

Bugfix from 12 april 2022
   - Fixed day_sort_guide, now he sorts guide correctly
     (not through the ass, may the editor forgive me when I put a broken program guide)
   - deleted shit code (not all)
   - added nice code

Update from 22 april 2022
   - settings for editing program guide are now external
     (no more hardcoded data)

Update from 16 july 2022
   - added setting for checking markers
         before:
          12.34 - premiere! shit show
          56.78 - shit show
         after:
          12.34, 56.78 - shit show
   - added setting for checking name of series of the show
         before:
          12.34 - shit show-2 shit in my ass
          56.78 - shit show-2 shit in my pantsu 
         after:
          12.34, 56.78 - shit show
   - added timer for measure the script running time

Update from 1 september 2022
  - added flag --pages for setting 1-page or 2-page format of program guide
    1-page format: -1 channel and no of spaces between channels
    2-page format: all channels and there are spaces
    example: python imlazyaf.py --pages 1(or 2)
    all of incorrect data converting to 2 (if you enter --pages 3 or -1 or nothing or "i'm degenerate" 
    then the program will output the result intended for --pages 2)
  - filters and whitelist moved to 'settings' directory
